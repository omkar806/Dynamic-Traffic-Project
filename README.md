# Dynamic-Traffic-Project
It was a government funded traffic management project done by me and my peers from IOT Forum VIIT.
This System dynamically manages the traffic on a 4 Lane intersection by Detecting the maximum vehicles from a particular lane and then updating the
timers of the lane itself and other lanes.The Tech Stack that we used for developing this system were , Raspbian OS , Python for Detecting the Vehicles 
and counting the number of detected vehicles and according to the count updating the Traffic Timer.I Used Deep Learning and Computer Vision for Vehicle Detection and
used RPI.GPIO library for interfacing this detection + time calculation algorithm with the Relay Modules,etc.
